Bodybuilding judges evaluate competitors based on specific criteria that vary slightly depending on the organization (e.g., IFBB, NPC, or others) and the competition category (e.g., bodybuilding, physique, figure, bikini). However, the core judging criteria generally focus on the following aspects:

1. Muscularity
Definition: The size, density, and development of muscles.

What Judges Look For:

Well-developed muscles with clear separation and definition.

Proportional muscle growth across all body parts (e.g., no lagging muscle groups).

Striations and vascularity, especially in advanced categories like bodybuilding.

Example: In men’s bodybuilding, judges assess the mass and fullness of muscles like the quads, chest, and lats. In bikini or figure, muscularity is judged with an emphasis on toned, balanced development rather than extreme size.

2. Symmetry
Definition: The balance and proportion of the physique.

What Judges Look For:

Equal development between left and right sides of the body.

Proportional balance between upper and lower body (e.g., shoulders vs. quads).

Aesthetic harmony, where no single body part overshadows others.

Example: A competitor with massive arms but underdeveloped legs would score lower in symmetry.

3. Conditioning
Definition: The level of leanness and muscle definition, showing low body fat.

What Judges Look For:

Visible muscle striations and separation without excessive dehydration.

A “dry” look, where muscles pop without water retention.

Avoidance of overly emaciated or “flat” appearances due to extreme cutting.

Example: In bodybuilding, judges favor a shredded look with visible muscle fibers, while in bikini, a lean but softer look is preferred.

4. Posing and Presentation
Definition: How competitors showcase their physique through posing and stage presence.

What Judges Look For:

Execution of mandatory poses (e.g., double biceps, side chest, most muscular in bodybuilding).

Confidence, charisma, and stage presence.

Smooth transitions between poses and ability to highlight strengths while minimizing weaknesses.

Example: In women’s figure, judges assess the elegance of posing routines, while in men’s physique, a relaxed yet confident stance is key.

5. Overall Aesthetics
Definition: The overall visual appeal of the competitor’s physique and presentation.

What Judges Look For:

Proportions that align with the category’s ideal (e.g., V-taper for bodybuilding, hourglass shape for bikini).

Skin tone, tanning, and grooming (e.g., proper application of tanning products, no streaks).

Appropriate attire (e.g., posing suits that complement the physique).

Example: In bikini, judges prioritize a feminine, balanced look, while in classic physique, a “Golden Era” aesthetic with flowing lines is valued.

Category-Specific Nuances
Men’s Bodybuilding: Emphasis on extreme muscularity, conditioning, and size. Mandatory poses like the double biceps and most muscular are critical.

Men’s Physique: Focus on a lean, aesthetic upper body, with board shorts covering legs. Posing emphasizes a V-taper and charisma.

Women’s Figure: Balances muscularity with femininity, emphasizing symmetry and a defined but not overly shredded look.

Bikini: Prioritizes a toned, feminine physique with less emphasis on muscle mass and more on stage presence and overall aesthetics.

Classic Physique: Combines moderate muscularity with Golden Era aesthetics, focusing on symmetry, posing, and proportional development.

Judging Process
Rounds: Competitions typically include:

Prejudging: Where most scoring occurs, focusing on mandatory poses and comparisons.

Finals: Includes posing routines (often choreographed to music) and final comparisons.

Scoring: Judges rank competitors by assigning points (lower is better). Each judge’s rankings are tallied, and the competitor with the lowest total score wins.

Ties: Resolved by re-evaluating comparisons or considering the majority of judges’ preferences.

Additional Considerations
Category Standards: Each category has a distinct “ideal” physique. For example, bikini competitors are judged on a softer, less muscular look compared to figure competitors.

Subjectivity: While criteria are standardized, judges’ preferences can introduce some subjectivity, especially in aesthetics and presentation.

Rule Variations: Organizations like the IFBB, NPC, or natural federations (e.g., OCB, INBA) may have slight differences in emphasis or rules (e.g., natural federations ban performance-enhancing substances).
