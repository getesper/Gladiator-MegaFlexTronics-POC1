## üèÜ IFBB Judging Criteria (Gold Standard)

### What Professional Judges Evaluate
1. **Muscularity** (size, fullness, muscle density)
2. **Symmetry** (balanced proportions, no overdeveloped/underdeveloped areas)
3. **Conditioning** (5% body fat, muscle definition, striations, vascularity)
4. **Presentation** (posing execution, stage presence, confidence)
5. **Proportions** (limb ratios, muscle insertions, aesthetic flow)

### Mandatory Poses (Men's Open)
- Front double biceps
- Front lat spread
- Side chest
- Back double biceps
- Back lat spread
- Side triceps
- Abdominals & thighs

### Scoring System
- 7-9 judges rank competitors (placement-based, not absolute points)
- Lowest cumulative score wins
- High/low scores dropped to reduce bias

## üìä Biomechanical Analysis Approaches

### Key Metrics We Can Add
1. **Joint Angles**
   - Elbow flexion (front double biceps: 70-90¬∞)
   - Knee angle (front lat spread: 160-180¬∞)
   - Shoulder abduction angles

2. **Symmetry Indices**
   - Left vs. right limb positioning
   - Bilateral muscle balance scores

3. **Muscle Engagement Indicators**
   - Lat spread width ratio
   - Quad separation visibility
   - Triceps peak detection

4. **Stability Metrics**
   - Center of mass deviation
   - Balance scores during static poses

### Implementation Tools
- **OpenCap (Stanford)** - Smartphone-based biomechanical modeling
- **YOLOv8-Pose** - Extract joint coordinates
- **Custom algorithms** - Calculate angles from MediaPipe landmarks
